Go to Line ``124`` and change the ``Server_Name`` to anything you want.
Go to line ``129`` and change the ``Discord: DISCORD_INVITE_LINK`` to anything you want.
To change rules go to line ``198`` and ``210``

You can change the Loading Screen music by replacing the audio.mp3 with another music mp3 file but the file HAS to be called audio.mp3
